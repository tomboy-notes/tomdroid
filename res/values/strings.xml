    	Welcome to Tomdroid.
    	\n\nPlease note that this is beta quality software and that it contains known problems. 
    	Like its inability to edit notes and its slow startup.

    	\n\nWe are well aware of these issues and intend to work on them quickly but I also wanted to get something
    	out and tested as quickly as possible.
    	
    	\n\nIf you would like to contribute, help at all levels would be appreciated. 
    	Hop on board on launchpad.net/tomdroid and contact us!\n
