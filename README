  3- Select "downloads" and click to download the tomdroid-<version>.apk
  
- Using the Android SDK with the phone connected through USB

Usage
=====
NEW: Read "Tomdroid's first note" note, it will provide instructions on getting started.

For SD Card sync, here are old instructions on how to copy your notes to the SD Card.
You can either:
* Plug in your sdcard and copy the notes to it:
  # mkdir /media/sdcard/tomdroid/; cp ~/.local/share/tomboy/*.note /media/sdcard/tomdroid/

* Use adb to push the notes while your phone is plugged in by USB:
  1- Make sure /sdcard/tomdroid/ exists
     # adb shell
     > mkdir /sdcard/tomdroid
     > exit
  2- Pushing the individual note files:
     # adb push <note file> /sdcard/tomdroid/
  3- Repeat step 2 as needed.

Uninstall
=========
On your phone under Settings -> Applications -> Manage applications
Or if you have the SDK installed
1- Plug in your device
2- Run:
   # adb -d uninstall org.tomdroid
